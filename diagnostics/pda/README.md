# Shank PDA/Seeds impl Overhead

Measuring effects on `.so` artifact caused by `impl` functions generated by _shank_ to derive
_seeds_ and _PDA_s.

## Seeds/PDA Function Effects

This diagnosis was performed on the [tictactoe workshop](https://github.com/thlorenz/tictactoe)
which was hand rolling pda + seeds derivation.

TODO: add a link to the relevant PR in tictactoe that changed that.

According to this analysis the following was shown:

- adding `impl` methods that aren't used in the code **does not add to the size of the `.so`**
  artifact
- only when `impl` methods are invoked are they included in the binary and add to its size
- due to _shank's_ efficient function reuse invoking its generated methods instead of the
  hand-rolled versions resulted in a smaller `.so` size (at least in this example)
  - final size ends up being smaller since _shank_ reuses the seed array creation code, vs. the
    hand rolled implementation inlined that code in two places.

### Details

For the following seeds specification:

```rs
#[derive(Debug, BorshSerialize, BorshDeserialize, ShankAccount)]
#[seeds("tictactoe", game("The key of the game"))]
pub struct Game {
    pub player_x: Pubkey,
    // [ .. ]
}
```

_shank_ generates the following code:

```rs
impl Game {
    #[allow(unused, clippy::needless_lifetimes)]
    pub fn shank_seeds<'a>(game: &'a ::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey) -> [&'a [u8]; 2usize] {
        [b"tictactoe", game.as_ref()]
    }
    #[allow(unused, clippy::needless_lifetimes)]
    pub fn shank_seeds_with_bump<'a>(
        game: &'a ::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey,
        bump: &'a [u8; 1],
    ) -> [&'a [u8]; 3usize] {
        [b"tictactoe", game.as_ref(), bump]
    }
    #[allow(unused)]
    pub fn shank_pda(
        program_id: &::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey,
        game: &::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey,
    ) -> (::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey, u8) {
        let seeds = Self::shank_seeds(game);
        ::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey::find_program_address(&seeds, program_id)
    }
    #[allow(unused)]
    pub fn shank_pda_with_bump(
        program_id: &::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey,
        game: &::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey,
        bump: u8,
    ) -> (::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey, u8) {
        let bump_arg = &[bump];
        let seeds = Self::shank_seeds_with_bump(game, bump_arg);
        ::solana_program::pubkey::Pubkey::find_program_address(&seeds, program_id)
    }
}
```

The `.so` size for the different options were recorded + `cargo build-bpf --dump` results
included (differences between dumps are best viewed via `vim -d dump1.txt dump2.txt`):

- `.so` size with shank that did not generate any code: `90.704K` ([./dumps/01_shank-orig.txt](./dumps/01_shank-orig.txt))
- `.so` size when not specifying seeds: `90.704K` ([./dumps/02_shank-no-seeds.txt](./dumps/02_shank-no-seeds.txt))
- `.so` size when specifying seeds without using them: `90.704K` ([./dumps/03_shank-unused-seeds.txt](./dumps/03_shank-unused-seeds.txt))
- `.so` size when specifying seeds using `seeds_with_bump`: `90.752K` ([./dumps/04_shank-using-seeds-with-bump.txt](./dumps/04_shank-using-seeds-with-bump.txt))
- `.so` size when specifying seeds using `seeds_with_bump` and removing use of hand-rolled
  seeds assignment: `90.704K` ([./dumps/05_shank-using-seeds-with-bump-only.txt](./dumps/05_shank-using-seeds-with-bump-only.txt))
- `.so` size when using shank pda impl, keeping hand rolled use `90.960K` ([./dumps/06_shank-using-pda-additionally.txt](./dumps/06_shank-using-pda-additionally.txt))
- `.so` size when using shank pda impl only `90.672K` ([./dumps/07_shank-using-pda-only.txt](./dumps/07_shank-using-pda-only.txt))
